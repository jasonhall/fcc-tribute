            <p><strong>Miyamoto Musashi</strong> could have been the greatest swordsman who ever lived, but much
            information about him is not certain. He came from a time of limited records, and his own writings and art
            were only about strategy, swordsmanship, and spirituality.</p>

            <ol>
              <li>He was born around 1584 in a village called Miyamoto in the province of Harima. He took his name from
              the village and his original name is not clear.</li>
              <li>His father was a samurai, but the identity of his mother is not certain.</li>
              <li>He likely learned swordsmanship originally from his father. He learned to read and write, and abut
              Zen Buddhism from an uncle.</li>
              <li>He won his first duel against a samurai at age 13, and his second at around 16.</li>
              <li>He was on the losing side of a battle and survived, but became ronin - a samurai without a
              master.</li>
              <li>He traveled around Japan for many years perfecting his skills and participating in duels against
              accomplished swordsmen. (Most duels were to determine the better martial artist - not to kill the
              opponent.)</li>
              <li>He usually arrived late - perhaps in order to anger his opponent.</li>
              <li>He developed a system of using two swords rather than one.</li>
              <li>In later years, he usually used a wooden sword, regardless of what his opponent used - even if the
              duel was to be to death.</li>
              <li>He is credited with over 60 known duels, with others uncounted, such as on battlefields - winning
              every one.</li>
              <li>He was an accomplished artist, poet, and strategist.</li>
              <li>While living as a hermit, he wrote "The Book of Five Rings" - a famous book about strategy that is
              still studied today and applied to other fields, such as business.</li>
              <li>He is believed to have died from lung cancer past the age of 60.</li>
